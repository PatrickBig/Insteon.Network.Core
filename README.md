## Synopsis

The intent behind this project is to bring C# developers into the home automation space with Insteon.

This project is a fork of the Insteon.Network portion of the project located here: https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=insteon

The intent is to provide .NET Core developers an interface to communicate with Insteon devices through the USB PLM.

## Code Example

Coming soon...

## Motivation

I am a hobbiest and a .NET enthusiast. I recently got into the home automation and I was a bit disappointed to learn that there really is not much out there for a C# developer. I want to try and change that slowly if possible.

## Tests

Most of the tests will fail unless you actually are connected via a Serial or USB PLM. The tests are currently pretty light but I intend to expand.
